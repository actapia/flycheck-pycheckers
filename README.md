# flycheck-pycheckers-ios
[flycheck-pycheckers](https://github.com/msherry/flycheck-pycheckers) package with some small changes to make it compatible with jailbroken iOS 11.3.1.

Actually, this may just be a workaround for using `flycheck-pycheckers` with [MCApollo's](https://mcapollo.github.io/Public/) `Python@3.7` package, but I haven't gotten around to testing other versions of Python 3 available in other repositories or building it myself (and I don't want to break my configuration yet).

This package was tested with Emacs 26.1, installed with the `emacs` package from [MCApollo's Cydia repo](https://mcapollo.github.io/Public/).

For more information, check out the [original README](README.upstream.md), or visit the original GitHub repository for [flycheck-pycheckers](https://github.com/msherry/flycheck-pycheckers).
